            <div class="section">
                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>The history of hospitals began in antiquity with hospitals in Greece, the Roman Empire and on the
                    Indian subcontinent as well, starting with precursors in the Asclepian temples in ancient Greece and
                    then the military hospitals in ancient Rome. The Greek temples were dedicated to the sick and infirm
                    but did not look anything like modern hospitals. The Romans did not have dedicated, public
                    hospitals. Public hospitals, per se, did not exist until the Christian period.[1] Towards the end of
                    the 4th century, the "second medical revolution"[2] took place with the founding of the first
                    Christian hospital in the eastern Byzantine Empire by Basil of Caesarea, and within a few decades,
                    such hospitals had become ubiquitous in Byzantine society.[3] The hospital would undergo development
                    and progress throughout Byzantine, medieval European and Islamic societies from the 5th to the 15th
                    century. European exploration brought hospitals to colonies in North America, Africa, and Asia. The
                    Hôtel-Dieu, founded in 1443 by Nicolas Rolin and Guigone de Salins, is widely considered the oldest
                    functioning hospital today. Originally a charitable institution for the poor, it now stands as a
                    museum known for its impressive architecture. In contrast, the Mihintale Hospital in Sri Lanka,
                    established in the 4th century BCE, holds the title of the oldest hospital overall, although it may
                    not be in its original form. Serving monks and the local community, it represents early advancements
                    in healthcare practices</p>

                <h2>Achievements and Specializations</h2>
                <p><b> Core Specialized Medical Care Services</b>

                    Core Specialized Medical Care Services represent the core business of KFSH&RC. Several
                    significant achievements were accomplished in providing these services through many programs,
                    including those in organ transplantation, neurosciences, oncology, cardiovascular diseases,
                    genetics, and advanced medical home care.

                    Access to the specialized services increased significantly in 2021 with a jump in the total
                    number of newly accepted patients by 44%. In addition, the total number of patients seen in
                    different Core Specialized Medical Care Services increased by 31%.
                    <br>

                    <br>

                    <b> Organ Transplant Center of Excellence (OTCoE)</b>
                    KFSH&RC has nine distinguished adult and pediatric transplantation programs: Heart, Stem
                    Cell, Liver, Kidney, Lung, Pancreas, Bone Grafts, Small Intestine, and Corneal.

                    Since the inception of each program, our caregivers have been producing the best outcomes in
                    the region, including speed to transplant, organ acceptance, and patients’ survival.

                    In 2021, there were 3,640 patients accepted with a 60% increase compared to 2020. A total of
                    1,367 transplant procedures (solid organ and stem cell) were successfully conducted in 2021.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <b> Stem Cell Transplant Program</b>
                    A total of (479) stem cell transplantations were performed 300 adults and 179 pediatric
                    patients.

                    This is a 35% increase compared to 2020 with exceptional survival rates.

                    An estimated (7,649) stem cell transplantations of bone marrow and umbilical cord blood
                    for adults and pediatrics have been administered since the start of the program in 1984.

                    Stem cell from the bone marrow or umbilical cord blood are transplanted from several
                    sources, including allogeneic donors, the same patient’s autologous stem, cord blood
                    stem cells, stem cells samples purchased from CIBMTR matched with the patient, and stem
                    cells matched from the KFSH&RC Stem Cell Donor Registry.

                    The number of registered donors at KFSH&RC reached 1,191 in 2021, and a total of 77,093
                    donations has been recorded.

                    <br>
                    <br>


                    <b> Heart Transplant Program</b>
                    The program is the largest in the region and is placed among the top international
                    cardiac transplantation programs.

                    Since its inception in 1989, the total number of heart transplants in the Hospital
                    has reached (413).

                    In 2021, we performed (26) transplants 10 in pediatric patients compared to 20 in
                    2020, a 30% increase with excellent survival rates.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <b> Liver Transplant Program</b>
                    In 2021, a total of (286) liver transplants were performed, compared to (159) in
                    2020, an increase of 80% 185 adults and 101 pediatric patients.

                    In addition, more than (501) robotic living-donor hepatectomies were performed
                    since the program began, the largest series in the world.

                    KFSH&RC continues to be the only center in the world where 100% of liver donors
                    benefit from a minimally invasive robotic transplant surgery procedure that
                    positively impacts donors’ quality of life and experience.

                    <br>
                    <b> Kidney Transplant Program</b>

                    Between 1981 and 2021, a total of (6,025) kidney transplants were performed by
                    KFSH&RC, which produced some of the best outcomes in the region, including speed
                    to transplant, organ acceptance, and patient survival.

                    In 2021, (542) kidney transplants were performed, a 110% increase compared to
                    2020.

                    A total of (39) cases were robotically assisted. Overall, patients’ survival
                    rates were outstanding.
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    <b> Lung Transplant Program</b>
                    KFSH&RC houses the only lung transplant program in Saudi Arabia, the GCC region,
                    and the Arab world. The program started in 1998 providing comprehensive care for
                    patients before and after lung transplantation.

                    Since 2000, we have performed lung transplantation for (268) patients.

                    In 2021, we performed (32) transplants compared to 20 in 2020, an increase of
                    60% with excellent survival rates.
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    <b> Pancreas Transplant Program</b>
                    Pancreas transplantation is the most viable treatment for Type 1 diabetic
                    patients who have end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or advanced chronic kidney
                    disease (CKD). KFSH&RC started the pancreas transplant program in 2004.

                    Thus far, KFSH&RC’s multidisciplinary team performed (56) pancreas transplants
                    with high success rates.

                    In 2021, two procedures were performed, and both patients are still alive and
                    functioning.

                    <br>
                    <b> Oncology Center</b>
                    A number of integrated services for patients with different types of cancer are
                    provided, including preventive programs such as the genetic diagnosis of embryos
                    prior to transplantation, rectal and colon genetic cancer screenings.

                    Heavily centered on providing therapies for its patients, the Oncology Center
                    offers advanced biological therapies in certain cases, replacing traditional
                    chemotherapy.

                    In 2021, the number of courses recorded are as follows:

                    Biological medicine therapy (113,587).
                    Traditional chemotherapy (112,948).
                    Radiotherapy (85,846).
